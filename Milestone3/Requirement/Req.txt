FOOD IMAGES:
ALT = TITLE = " ‘food title’ di ‘restaurant_associated’ "

RESTAURANT IMAGES:
ALT = TITLE = "‘restaurant title’" 

There should be a simple check for multiple pictures:
The first picture for each food or restaurant will have the structure above.
The second picture of a food should be " ‘food title’_2 di ‘restaurant_associated’ " 
...
The n picture of a food should be " ‘food title’_n di ‘restaurant_associated’ "

Same for restaurant ("‘restaurant title’_n")

If (" ‘food title’ di ‘restaurant_associated’ " NOT exist) -> assign ALT and TITLE
else
While with n from 2 to whatever
If (" ‘food title’_n di ‘restaurant_associated’ " NOT exist) -> assign ALT and TITLE
