You can use Elasticpress plugin to customize your searches.

Integrate Wordpress with Elasticsearch
  a. In Settings, Go to Third-Party/Self-Hosted since we are using es in aws ec2,  and put your host in Elasticsearch Host URL
    in your case -  http://52.14.225.213:9200
  b. Index Health - You can check if you are connected to es and es is up. If not, it will warn you.
  c. Search Fields and weighting - You can define which fields to be searchable and weights for each.
  d. you can customize search results, arrange sorting order for specific results, attach docs in result, which may be related
    but not retreivable from search terms.
  e. customize query for further custom results -
  /wp-content/plugins/elasticpress/includes/classes/Indexable/Post/Post.php - line 1042 onwards

This header in the search response identifies that request is processed through elasticpress.
