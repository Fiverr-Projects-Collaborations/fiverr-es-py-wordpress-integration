aws info provided:
email: fabri.casella@gmail.com
password: 8i_.93i;.*nsum

NOTE: We don't have elastic IP for aws instance, so if possible don't stop the ec2 instance, reboot instead,
otherwise public IP would change and you need to change new IP everywhere.

command to ssh into ec2 instance:
ssh -i idlike-aws.pem ec2-user@52.14.225.213

NOTE: idlike.pem is provided along
